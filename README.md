Luca Brainstorming:
- X Drive (most manueverable, fastest, and coolest. Would allow us to juke most other robots and reduce time wasted turning - we can literally turn while driving with some mad coding)
- Extendable arm (probably scissor arm)
  - If made manueverable enough, could grab and lift triballs, as well as pull robot near top of pole at end
  - If given near-180 degree rotation vertically, this arm could also through triballs with high accuracy. When on defense, it could sit touching the ball load zone, get constantly loaded with triballs, and throw them constantly into our zone. We'd need to design a way to make it fast and strong, possibly with a rubber band system (just have to make sure our robot doesn't beat itself up too bad with repeated stopping of this high velocity arm!!)
  - This one arm could do literally everything we need. Because of our X Drive and because it can go in and out, it literally pick up triballs in passing and swing around to put them into the goal without the robot stopping.

## X Drive
#### X-Drive. A four wheel bot with each wheel in the corner of a square frame and the sides of each wheel facing central.Â

This is the most manuvurable of the chassis and can change directions without turning. It is also quite fast compared to all of the options. We think using this omni-directional chassis will make the engineering and programming elements of our bot easier because we will have less to deal with from our bot turning or needing to reposition itself in order to move foward. On top of that, it is the cooolest looking chassis so we have a obligation to pick it.
