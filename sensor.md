# Sensor System 

We are programming a sensor on our bot so we can determine the bots front and turning displacement from pointing foward. Knowing this will let us give the bot's driver the ability to reset the bot's front position making sure the controls are never inverted. THis will make driving much easier making completeing tasks more likely.

You can see the senor up on the front of the bot with the red glow. 

## Code

So far we have used the sensor to program the tracking system meaning we know the bots displacement while driving. We have also programmed resetting the front of the bot and are now working on making the robot's controls change in cooridination with the front changing.
