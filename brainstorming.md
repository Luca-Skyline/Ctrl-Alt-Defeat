#Brainstorming

Luca Brainstorming:
- X Drive (most manueverable, fastest, and coolest. Would allow us to juke most other robots and reduce time wasted turning - we can literally turn while driving with some mad coding)
- Extendable arm (probably scissor arm)
  - If made manueverable enough, could grab and lift triballs, as well as pull robot near top of pole at end
  - If given near-180 degree rotation vertically, this arm could also trow triballs with high accuracy. When on defense, it could sit touching the ball load zone, get constantly loaded with triballs, and throw them constantly into our zone. We'd need to design a way to make it fast and strong, possibly with a rubber band system (just have to make sure our robot doesn't beat itself up too bad with repeated stopping of this high velocity arm!!)
  - This one arm could do literally everything we need. Because of our X Drive and because it can go in and out, it might be able to pick up triballs in passing and swing around to put them into the goal without the robot stopping.
 
Jacob Brainstorming:
- Robot needs to be able to climb pole
- Robot should be able to reach up to grab pole
- Scissor lift?
- Too complicated
- Telescoping arm?
- Not possible
- Scissor arm?
